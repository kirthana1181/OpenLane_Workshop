# Digital VLSI SoC - Design and Planning
In this workshop, I learned and shared my lab work on working with OpenLANE RTL2GDS digital design suite, NGSpice for Characterization, Magic for Layout and Floor planning, and discovered a few hands-on processes involved in the Physical Design of a SoC.
Through this workshop, I performed CMOS transient analysis, Layout and Characterization of the Inverter Cell using NgSPICE Simulation, and  exercises in the Magic Design Window, to find and fix errors in Magic for a few design files.
